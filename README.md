# 🧠 CTF Writeups

Welcome to my collection of CTF writeups! I'm currently a Bac+5 student at [École 2600](https://www.2600.eu), and I regularly participate in Capture The Flag competitions — mostly focused on **Web**, **OSINT**, and some **Forensics** challenges.

## Why I Do CTFs

I genuinely enjoy the CTF format because it's a fun and challenging way to **learn**, **improve**, and **push my limits** in cybersecurity. These challenges allow me to go beyond theory and get hands-on with real-world scenarios. Even better, I get to solve them alongside my classmates — it’s both a collaborative and competitive experience that I love.  
And lastly, I get to meet incredible and inspiring people.

## About This Repo

Each week, I document the challenges I work on — whether they're from school, public platforms, or online CTFs. My goal is not only to track my progress but also to help others who might be facing similar challenges.
