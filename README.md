# CTF Writeups

Welcome to my collection of CTF writeups! I'm currently a Bac+5 student at [√âcole 2600](https://www.2600.eu), and I regularly participate in Capture The Flag competitions ‚Äî mostly focused on **Web**, **OSINT**, and some **Forensics** challenges.

## Why I Do CTFs

I genuinely enjoy the CTF format because it's a fun and challenging way to **learn**, **improve**, and **push my limits** in cybersecurity. These challenges allow me to go beyond theory and get hands-on with real-world scenarios. Even better, I get to solve them alongside my classmates ‚Äî it‚Äôs both a collaborative and competitive experience that I love.  
And lastly, I get to meet incredible and inspiring people.

## About This Repo

Each week, I document the challenges I work on ‚Äî whether they're from school, public platforms, or online CTFs. My goal is not only to track my progress but also to help others who might be facing similar challenges.

## Platforms I Use
